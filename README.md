First, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the directory:

```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

```
On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

pip install django
```

### 5. Set Up the Database

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a Superuser Account

This account lets you log in to the Django admin panel and add your portfolio details.
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set username, email, and password.

    - **Projects**: Add your projects, descriptions, GitHub/live links, and order.

## Customization

- To change styles, edit files in [`static/css/`](static/css/).
- To update images, add them to [`static/images/`](static/images/).
- To modify templates, edit [`Base/templates/home.html`](Base/templates/home.html).

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an empty homepage, make sure you have added at least one User entry in the admin panel.
- For media uploads (avatars, resumes), ensure the [`media/`](media/) directory exists and is writable.
